-> This is my first Machine Learning model I have made.
-> This model generate No_of_calories burned by take input such as: Gender, Age, Weight, Height, Workout_Type, Resting, Water 
     intake, Fat_percentage, BPM etc.
-> In this model I use Multiple Linear Regression.

-> I use a Gym _member_excercise_data.csv dataset from the Kaggle.
-> In this project I use:
   1. Pandas
   2. Numpy
   3. Sklearn
   4. Seaborn
   5. Matplotlib
   6. Machine Learning(Supervised Learning)
Currently I am studying the Deep Learning
